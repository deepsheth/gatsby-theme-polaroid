            Yet so vain is man, and so <em>blinded by his vanity</em>, that no writer, up to the very end of the
            nineteenth century, expressed any idea that <a href="#">intelligent life</a> might have developed there far,
            or indeed at all, beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that since Mars is older than
            our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows
            that it is not only more distant from timeâ€™s beginning but nearer its end.
